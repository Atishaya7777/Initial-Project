# Initial-Project 
This is probably going to be the source code for the rock-paper-scissors project which I thought of.
It uses dictionaries to minimize the if else statements.
It also uses the module gtts, to translate the code into something that is read aloud by the computer.
Any help or feedback is greatly appreciated!
