# Simple console based rock-paper-scissors project 

This is probably going to be the source code for the rock-paper-scissors project which I thought of.

It uses dictionaries to minimize the if else statements.

It also uses the module gtts, to translate the code into something that is read aloud by the computer (Docs: https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Have fun with it!
